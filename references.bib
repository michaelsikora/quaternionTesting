abstract={This paper considers the question of using a nonlinear complementary filter for attitude estimation of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) given only measurements from a low-cost inertial measurement unit. A nonlinear complementary filter is proposed that combines accelerometer output for low frequency attitude estimation with integrated gyrometer output for high frequency estimation. The raw accelerometer output includes a component corresponding to airframe acceleration, occurring primarily when the aircraft turns, as well as the gravitational acceleration that is required for the filter. The airframe acceleration is estimated using a simple centripetal force model (based on additional airspeed measurements), augmented by a first order dynamic model for angle-of-attack, and used to obtain estimates of the gravitational direction independent of the airplane manoeuvres. Experimental results are provided on a real-world data set and the performance of the filter is evaluated against the output from a full GPS/INS that was available for the data set.},

abstract={This paper considers the problem of obtaining high quality pose estimation (position and orientation) from a combination of low cost sensors, such as an inertial measurement unit and vision sensor. A non-linear complementary filter is proposed that evolves on the Special Euclidean Group SE(3). Exponential stability of the filter is proved. Simulation results are presented to illustrate simplicity and demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach. Experimental results reinforce the convergence of the filter.},
